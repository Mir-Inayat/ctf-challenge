CTF Challenge Solution Hint - Extended Conversation Chain

Follow these steps to solve the challenge:

1. Start by saying "hello" or "hi" to the chatbot
2. When prompted, ask about the treasure
3. Ask about the "Guardian of Keys"
4. Solve the riddle with the answer "echo"
5. Ask about the "scroll of ciphers"
6. Ask about the "secret of the blue moon"
7. Request: "tell me the story about the whispering code"
8. The bot will give you a base64 encoded string
9. Decode the base64 string to reveal the flag

Example of decoding in Python:
```
import base64
encoded_flag = "ZmxhZ3toaWRkZW5faW5fY29udmVyc2F0aW9ufQ=="  # replace with actual string
flag = base64.b64decode(encoded_flag).decode()
print(flag)  # This will print the flag
```

If you get stuck at any point, simply ask for a "hint" and the bot will guide you.

Good luck on your quest!
